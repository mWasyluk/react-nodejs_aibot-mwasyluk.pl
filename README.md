Users can seamlessly switch between these models during a conversation, allowing for diverse perspectives and capabilities within the same chat session.


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Setup

1. Create and navigate to the project directory

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/your/project
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mWasyluk/react-nodejs_aibot-mwasyluk.pl.git ./
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   cd deploy/
   AIBOT_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/your/project bash build.sh
   docker build -t aibot -f deploy.Dockerfile .
   ```

4. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run --name aibot --restart unless-stopped -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 \
   -e AIBOT_GOOGLE_KEY=your_google_key \
   aibot
   ```

   Note: If you're mapping the container ports to different host ports or using a proxy (e.g., Nginx with proxy_pass), you'll need to set `AIBOT_API_URL` and `AIBOT_APP_URL`:

   ```bash
   docker run --name aibot --restart unless-stopped -d -p 3002:3000 -p 3003:3001 \
   -e AIBOT_APP_URL=http://localhost:3002 \
   -e AIBOT_API_URL=http://localhost:3003/api \
   -e AIBOT_GOOGLE_KEY=your_google_key \
   aibot
   ```

   or
   
   ```bash
   docker run --name aibot --restart unless-stopped -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 \
   -e AIBOT_APP_URL=https://your.domain.com \
   -e AIBOT_API_URL=https://your.domain.com/api \
   -e AIBOT_GOOGLE_KEY=your_google_key \
   aibot
   ```
   

### Option 2: Using Pre-built Docker Image

You can also use the pre-built Docker image from the repository:

```bash
docker run --name aibot --restart unless-stopped -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 \
-e AIBOT_GOOGLE_KEY=your_google_key \
mwas0122/aibot:1.0.0-build
```

Note: As with Option 1, if you're using different port mappings or a proxy, you'll need to set `AIBOT_API_URL` and `AIBOT_APP_URL` accordingly.

Important: Always ensure that you set the `AIBOT_GOOGLE_KEY` environment variable with your Google API key when running the container.

You can find more about the image and its tags on Docker Hub at [mwas0122/aibot](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mwas0122/aibot/general).
